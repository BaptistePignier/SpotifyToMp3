[Json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) and [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)<br />
[Youtube_dl](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/)<br />
[youtube-search-python](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-search-python/)<br />

First replace the url at the top of the code with the one you want <br />
Then  : <br />
```
